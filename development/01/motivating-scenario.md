## Name
Digitization activities

## Description
A digitization workflow involves a series of activities carried out by some agents during a certain period of time. These activites involve using various software and hardware tools to capture, process, transform, and publish the digital versions of the physical objects that are meant to be digitized. Although these activities can vary depending on the nature of the materials being digitised and the intended use of the digital files, our tracked work included the following phases in the digitisation process of all objects:
* acquisition: a digitization activity meant to capture analogue materials and acquire their digital representation;
* processing: a digitization activity meant to manipulate digital files in order to facilitate further operations on them;
* modelling: a digitization activity meant to create a full digital model of the object and/or space surrounding it;
* optimization: a digitization activity to optimise the digital files for specific purposes or use cases;
* export: a digitization activity meant to convert the digital files into a specific format;
* description metadata creation (or simply metadata creation): a digitization activity meant to create structured metadata describing the content and context of the digital files;
* provenance metadata creation (or simply provenance creation): a digitization activity meant to create provenance metadata to track the agent responsible for data creation, the time of data creation, and the primary source of the data;
* upload: a digitization meant to transfer digital 3D models from a local device or storage location to a Web-based framework.
